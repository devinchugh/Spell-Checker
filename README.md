This will do the basic task of showing the weather for the city entered.

My project is all about solving the problem for those people who wish to monitor real-time stock prices of some particular stocks. It uses an API from IEX Cloud to get the prices for stock added. It also have a backend to store the stocks name added by user.
I also wish to add delete operation to it in upcoming time.
